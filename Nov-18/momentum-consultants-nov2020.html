                                This fall has remained an unsettling time. Organizations are adapting quickly to help
                                employees manage the health and financial challenges many are experiencing. In this
                                issue, we share findings on our financial stress research and how many Americans are
                                struggling financially and making decisions they may later regret. Other topics include
                                offering expanded support for Career Transition Planning, preparations to address any
                                future market volatility, and enhancement to our mobile app.

                                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic is continuing to take a toll on our nation, with the more than
                                    100,000 daily new cases confirmed today, according to <a
                                        href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases" target="_blank">John
                                        Hopkins University</a> data.
                                    In addition to the concerns that Americans have about their health and their
                                    families, they also face very real challenges with their careers and finances.</p>
                                <p>Thousands of workers are furloughed as businesses adapt to our new reality, and many
                                    more have been laid off and are struggling to cover their living expenses, including
                                    rent, mortgage and medical bills.</p>
                                <p>As we work with clients to address these challenges, one thing remains clear: Workers
                                    across our country need help more than ever before. Our nation is stressed and
                                    swirling in a painful spiral of uncertainty surrounding the presidential and
                                    congressional elections; what will happen in the stock and bond markets; when and if
                                    another stimulus package will be available; and how long it will be before a vaccine
                                    is widely distributed. It’s not surprising that all of this uncertainty is taking
                                    its toll on the U.S. workforce.</p>

                                        to their retirement plans to pay their bills. While this may seem like a viable
                                        solution in the short term, it comes with a heavy price. Over half (55%) of
                                        workers who have withdrawn or borrowed money from their 401(k)s ended up
                                        regretting it.

                                        alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>When we asked employees why they were using their retirement assets for reasons
                                        other than retirement, they blamed their lack of understanding about the
                                        implications and said they didn’t realize there were other options available to
                                        them. In fact, four in five (81%) retirement investors say they could have
                                        benefited by talking with a financial advisor before taking a loan. While we are
                                        flooded with financial advice and information from the internet, friends,
                                        family, the news and TV commercials, clearly employees are not getting the
                                        trusted advice needed when they are making life-altering financial decisions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I believe the remedy is right in front of us. Workers deserve to have better
                                        access to high-quality financial education and objective advice. Employers are
                                        uniquely positioned to provide this. And more than 4 in 5 employees would value
                                        an employee benefit from their employer that provided access to financial
                                        advice. Help can take many forms — from increasing education on important
                                        financial concepts like budgeting or managing debt to providing financial
                                        coaches and planners at key life moments — such as onboarding at a new job or
                                        transitioning from the firm.</p>
                                    <p>More good news: Many mistakes can be fixed or mitigated with proper advice.
                                        Helping employees move past their financial mistakes and to learn from them — or
                                        even better yet, avoiding them in the first place — can be an enormous benefit
                                        to help improve overall financial well-being, reduce stress, and also help
                                        improve overall wellness and productivity.</p>
                                    <p>With regrets come opportunities for workers to learn and empower themselves to
                                        course correct and get back on the path to achieving their goals and realizing
                                        their dreams, whether it be buying a home, paying for a son or daughter’s
                                        college education, caring for elderly parents or investing and saving for
                                        retirement.</p>
                                    <p>Share with me your ideas on how we can help employees avoid financial regrets.

                                    Economic uncertainty due to Covid-19 has caused significant stress for many
                                    Americans and is inflicting additional trauma on an already fragile state of
                                    financial security. Research conducted by Edelman Financial Engines during our 2020
                                    thought leadership series reveals that employers can help by providing advice via
                                    the workplace. In the second and third studies, we offer insights from our latest
                                    research along with prescriptive solutions outlining how lack of financial advice
                                    for employees can lead to regrettable financial decisions.

                                        Our research indicates a strong desire among employees for more comprehensive
                                        financial guidance. Most U.S. employees feel that professional, conflict-free
                                        advice is out of their reach. Employers can step in and close the advice gap by
                                        helping employees get the financial advice they need — and can trust — which can

                                        improve work productivity.

                                            Many employees are caught in the cycle of poor financial decision-making and
                                            high financial stress. Employees with high financial stress are 1.6 times
                                            more likely to receive and act on “bad financial advice” than those with
                                            lower stress levels, while those who received and acted on “bad financial
                                            advice” are 1.4 times more likely to report “a lot of financial stress” – a
                                            vicious cycle.

                                        of 1,238 retirement plan participants fielded on the Qualtrics platform in

                                        <strong>Tapping Retirement Assets Early</strong><br>
                                        Compounding financial stress is that the lack of access to financial advice can
                                        cause employees to take actions detrimental to their long-term financial
                                        security. Our research reveals Covid-19’s financial impact on employees — and
                                        actions they subsequently took, including borrowing from retirement plans. The
                                        absence of financial education and personal coaching, coupled with easy access
                                        to retirement funds, is letting employees plunge themselves into a debilitating
                                        financial crisis. There is no reason for employers to hesitate in providing
                                        additional help to their workforce — employees want their employers to help
                                        them.

                                    Emotions are high this year, and many are wondering if they should change their
                                    investment strategy. In a recent 30-minute webinar, Ric offers his historic
                                    perspective (plus his experience gained from advising clients over nine presidential
                                    elections) to explain why investors who let their political views color their
                                    investment decisions, or who invest based on the winning party, run the risk of
                                    making bad financial decisions.

                                    Coping with financial stress can be difficult at any time — and the persistent
                                    uncertainty during Covid-19 makes decision-making even more challenging. Our recent
                                    one-hour webinar — with Ric Edelman, Founder, Edelman Financial Engines; Tia Padia,
                                    VP, Edelman Financial Engines Workplace Division; and Jack VanDerhei, Director of
                                    Research, Employee Benefits Research Institute — offers a snapshot into what your
                                    employees need to reduce their stress and improve financial security, especially a
