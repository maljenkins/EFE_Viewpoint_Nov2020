                                    This year marked new terrain for all of us. We entered 2020
                                    amid the lon- gest bull run in history and then faced a
                                    pandemic crisis not experienced for generations. In April,
                                    Edelman Financial Engines continued our existing research on
                                    employee financial well-being, understanding that many Amer-
                                    ican workers were still in whiplash — and only starting to
                                    manage financial stress during the unprecedented
                                    uncertainty.

                                        We learned that financial well-being was already weak at
                                        the onset of Covid-19, across multiple measures, including
                                        financial stress, prosperity, and emergency readiness.
                                        More than half of workers agreed they had “a lot” of
                                        financial stress in their lives or faced severe challenges
                                        in raising $2,000 during an emergency. These senses of
                                        financial fragility are unlike- ly to dissipate anytime
                                        soon, given the unknowns of Covid-19 and the re- lated
                                        impact on the economy and market volatility.

                                        Our research closely looked at how work performance is
                                        affected by high financial stress. As employees were
                                        grappling with the emotional stress of quarantine
                                        measures, they were often thinking about potential job
                                        loss or Covid-19 related absences. Employees told us that
                                        financial stress is detri- mental to their job
                                        performance. Areas affected according to survey re-
                                        sponses were diminished productivity, loss of focus,
                                        working when sick or tired, and sometimes even anger and
                                        tension related to their financial issues.

                                        As a trusted source, employers are in a unique position to
                                        help participants find their path to well-being. Employers
                                        provide stability and familiarity when so many parts of
                                        daily lives have been interrupted. Addressing finan- cial
                                        well-being now not only helps participants cope with this
                                        new terrain but also reinforces trust and loyalty among
                                        employees.

                                    <strong>What happened</strong><br />
                                    Markets rose around the world in June. The S&P 500, an index
                                    of U.S. large cap stocks, was up by 1.99 percent. Small caps
                                    were up more, rising by 3.74 percent (S&P 600). Looking
                                    abroad, we see that international stocks were up by 3.41
                                    percent (MSCI EAFE Index). And bonds also had a good month
                                    too, with Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index up 0.63
                                    percent. Our simple measure of volatility in the stock
                                    market shows that June was a volatile month, with S&P 500
                                    moving by +/- one percent on 11 of the 22 trading days of
                                    the month. This was also the end of the second quarter of
                                    the year, which followed a steep fall in the first quarter.
                                    The S&P 500 rose by 20.54% over the past three months,
                                    making it the best quarterly return since the fourth quarter
                                    of 1998.

                                        <strong>Why it happened</strong><br />
                                        Uncertainty about the economic impact of the coronavirus
                                        pandemic drove markets in June. Market participants,
                                        trying to figure out how the coronavirus will impact
                                        companies’ performance, reacted strongly to good and bad
                                        news. As a result, markets experienced repeated ups and
                                        downs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Early in the month, the unemployment rate was reported
                                        and, instead of rising substantially as expected, actually
                                        fell slightly. In response, the S&P 500 rose by 2.6
                                        percent on June 5th. But on the 11th the S&P 500 fell by
                                        5.9 percent after news of spikes in coronavirus infection
                                        rates and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell
                                        predicting a slow economic recovery. Then there was
                                        positive news on the 16th as retail sales grew by 18
                                        percent, double what was predicted, sending markets back
                                        up. Another fall in markets came on the 24th as the
                                        International Monetary Fund said that the recession was
                                        worse than it had expected. There was also news of spikes
                                        in infections, leading multiple states to pause or
                                        backtrack on their reopening plans. Towards the end of the
                                        month, markets rose once more as pending home sales and
                                        the consumer confidence score beat expectations. After all
                                        these ups and downs, the S&P 500 closed up for the month.

                                        <strong>What this means for your participants</strong><br />
                                        At Edelman Financial Engines, we build personalized
                                        portfolios that reflect your participants’ risk
                                        preferences and goals. Their portfolio is likely to have
                                        risen in June, and slightly more so if they have a higher
                                        stock allocation. But, as we continue to see market
                                        volatility, it is important that participants are
                                        comfortable with their portfolio’s risk level. Your
                                        participants can log into their account and look at the
                                        impact of changing their risk preference. Or call one of
                                        our advisors to help determine the level of risk that is
                                        right for them.
